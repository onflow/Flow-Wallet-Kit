# Flow Wallet Kit Android Documentation

Welcome to the Flow Wallet Kit Android documentation. This SDK provides a comprehensive solution for integrating Flow blockchain wallet functionality into your Android applications.

## Core Components

- [Account Management](./account.mdx)
- [Wallet Management](./wallet.mdx)
- [Key Management](./keys.mdx)
- [Storage](./storage.mdx)
- [Security](./security.mdx)

- [Network](./network.mdx)
- [dApp Integration](./dapp.mdx)
- [Backup & Recovery](./backup.mdx)
- [Error Handling](./errors.mdx)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add Flow Wallet Kit to your project using Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.outblock:flow-wallet-kit:1.0.0'
}
```

### Basic Usage

```kotlin
import io.outblock.flowwalletkit.FlowWallet

// Initialize a wallet
val wallet = FlowWallet.create()

// Create an account
val account = wallet.createAccount()

// Sign a transaction
val signature = wallet.sign("Hello, Flow!")
```

## Requirements

- Android API level 21+ (Android 5.0 Lollipop)
- Kotlin 1.5+
- Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) or newer

## Architecture

The SDK is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components:

1. **Account Layer**: Handles Flow account management
2. **Wallet Layer**: Manages wallet operations and state
3. **Key Management**: Handles cryptographic key operations
4. **Storage Layer**: Provides secure data persistence
5. **Security Layer**: Implements platform security features
6. **Network Layer**: Handles blockchain interaction

Each component is designed to work independently while maintaining seamless integration with the rest of the SDK. Check out each component's documentation for detailed information about its functionality and usage.
