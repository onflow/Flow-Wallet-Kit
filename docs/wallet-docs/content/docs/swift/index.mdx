## Architecture

The SDK is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components:

1. **Account Layer**: Handles Flow account management
2. **Wallet Layer**: Manages wallet operations and state
3. **Key Management**: Handles cryptographic key operations
4. **Storage Layer**: Provides secure data persistence
5. **Security Layer**: Implements platform security features
6. **Network Layer**: Handles blockchain interaction

Check out each component's documentation for detailed information about its functionality and usage.
